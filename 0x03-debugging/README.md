#Debugging 
  In this project, we learned what is debugging and the *Rubber-Duck* methodolgy. It consists mainly of 4 steps
 1- Explain your (broken) code and its goals => *Context*
 2- Explain line-by-line the flow of the whole function or method that's not working => *Details*
 3- Explain intermediate states and transitions
 4- Find your *STUPID, OBVIOUS* solutions ! => *Find the problem*
